<h2> Uses of an elevator: </h2>
Going to a certain floor<br>
opening/closing door<br>
Calling for help if problem in elevator<br>
<br><br>
This interface makes common tasks easier because the floor buttons light up when pressed, though there is no feedback from the open/close door buttons

<h4>Common sequence of actions:</h4>
Enter elevator -> find button for floor -> press button -> close/hold open door

<h2> Support: </h2>
The elevator has labels on each button, numbers for floors and symbols for everything else. There is also braille next to each label.

<h2> Feedback: </h2>
The floor buttons on the elevator light up when pressed. You can also feel the buttons being fully pressed.

<h2> Common mistakes: </h2>
A common mistake could be pressing the wrong open/close door button.

<h2> Suggested improvements: </h2>
Separate the floor buttons from the open/close door and alarm buttons, have floors in 1 column and other buttons in a row at the bottom this will more clearly separate the floor buttons from the rest. Add feedback to the opening/closing buttons so people know if they are working. In my design i made them light up like the floor buttons.
